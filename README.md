NIR image sequences collected using different types of contact lenses. Collected at Clarkson University. Funded by the CITeR and National Science Foundation. Please see links below for additional details.

This biometric dataset collection contains data of Iris images and two sensors.

The purpose of this data collection is to develop an iris image database, specifically designed for use in the Iris Liveness Detection Competition (LivDet-Iris) â€“ The 2025 Edition.

Near-Infrared (NIR) image sequences were collected using a variety of contact lenses to study their impact on presentation attack detection (PAD) performance. These contact lenses were categorized into two main types based on their visual and structural properties: high-quality lenses, which have clear, uniform surfaces and minimal visual distortion, and pixelated lenses, which feature printed patterns or cosmetic designs that can introduce irregularities or occlusions in the captured eye images. This classification was used to analyze how different lens types affect the quality and reliability of PAD under NIR imaging conditions.

The dataset comprises 564 bona fide iris images and 788 samples captured from subjects wearing textured contact lenses. The presentation attack samples represent nine different contact lens, and are categorized into two quality classes: High Quality and Pixelated. 644 high-quality lenses originate from six different contact lens, while 144 pixelated samples originate from three other contact lens.
